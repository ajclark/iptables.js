A simple iptables ruleset generator written in JavaScript. I wrote this code for two reasons:

1. To teach myself JavaScript during the boring Christmas period (seasons greetings to all!)
2. To help demonstrate that many server-side scripts (e.g. iptables ruleset generators) can be written client-side.

I originally stumbled upon the excellent iptables generator: http://www.mista.nu/iptables/ and decided to re-write
the iptables generating code in javascript - as a Proof of Concept, while preserving all features and maintaining the excellent layout.

A demonstration can be found at: http://iptables-js.heroku.com

I consider this code Proof of Concept only.
